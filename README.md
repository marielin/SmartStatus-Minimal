SmartStatus Minimal (App Store)
=====================

**Warning**, This WatchApp is **ONLY** compatible with the App Store version of SmartWatch+

### Overview

I made this SmartStatus mod because all the other SmartStatus apps I found weren't minimalist enough for me. I've done my best to remove unnecessary features, and hopefully what's left is a better, more usable app.
